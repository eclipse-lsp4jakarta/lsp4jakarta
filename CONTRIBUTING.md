# Contributing to Eclipse LSP4Jakarta

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

A language server implementation based on the Language Server Protocol for the
Jakarta EE programming model.  This LSP4Jakarta (Language Server for Jakarta
EE) will provide core language support capabilities (such as code complete,
diagnostics, quick fixes) to enable developers to easily and quickly develop
cloud-native applications using the Jakarta EE APIs. The Eclipse client for the
Language Server for Jakarta EE will surface the capabilities provided by the
language server to developers using the Eclipse (desktop) IDE.
